Garbage collector for Logr JVM.


DESCRIPTION
===========

Logr JVM is Java Virtual Machine for Linux with bytecode to native compiler. 
I coded memory management and garbage collector (tri-color tracing). The 
implementation was inspired by algorithms from Knuth's legendary The Art of 
Computer Programming, Warren Abstract Machine (and other Prolog VMs) and 
Java garbage collector.
